*Project: Task Management Application
-This project is developed by using HTML, PHP/MySQL, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery/Ajax), and Bootstrap.
-The source code provided is fully operational and designed for ease of customization and enhancement. 
-To begin utilizing this straightforward task management solution, simply adhere to the instructions below for a hands-on experience


*Project Overview:
-This Task Management Application is designed as an intuitive tool to assist companies in monitoring and steering the progress of various tasks within projects. 
The platform is engineered to accommodate three distinct user roles: Administrator, Project Manager, and Employee. Administrators hold the highest level of access 
within the system, granting them comprehensive control over the entirety of the data repository. Their responsibilities encompass the creation and oversight of user accounts, 
ensuring the system's integrity and functionality. Project Managers wield the application to orchestrate the specifics and trajectory of projects within their purview. 
Their focus is on the micro-management of project particulars and supervising the advancement of tasks to meet designated milestones. Employees are required to input meticulous 
records of their productivity by logging the commencement and conclusion times for each assigned task. This pivotal data feeds into the systemâ€™s analytical engine, culminating 
in detailed reports that quantify the collective work durations of project participants.


*System Functionality:
-The Task Management Application is structured with a hierarchy of user roles and permissions, with administrative users being the sole individuals authorized to create new user 
accounts. Upon establishing a new project, either the admin or project managers must initially populate the project with relevant details and assign employees to the tasks at hand.
In the project setup phase, those with administrative or managerial roles are tasked with enlisting all employees who will be engaged with the project, delineating their specific 
responsibilities. Once the project is activated, employees are granted access to the system with the singular function of logging and modifying the status of their personal task 
progression. Employees have the capability to routinely update their task achievements and are permitted to alter only those progress entries that they have personally inputted. 
These continuous updates provide project managers with real-time insights into task completion rates, enabling them to verify finished tasks and adjust task statuses as necessary 
within the system. Regarding reporting, the privilege to generate and access comprehensive printable reports of the system is reserved exclusively for admin users and project managers. 
This feature ensures that sensitive data remains safeguarded and that oversight remains with those in governance roles.
